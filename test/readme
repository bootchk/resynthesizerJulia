Dimensions
==========

A main goal is the algorithm generic on type and dimension of data.

Thus the test programs are structured along dimensions, then data type.

1D/text  (e.g. stream of char.)
2D/
  image
  text  (e.g. poetry or paginated text)
3D/
  image (e.g. video)

dimensions.jl tests across all supported dimensions, 1D to 4D

Apps
====

The algorithm as several applications.

Most tests are the inpaint app.

/render tests the render app


Other
=====

case/   tests other images commonly used by other researchers

unit/    unit tests
