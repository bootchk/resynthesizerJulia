JuliaResynthesizer

The "Resynthesizer" algorithm for texture transfer in images.

Ported from C to Julia.
Derived from https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer.git.
Minimal changes to the algorithm, but significant refactoring.

!!! Work in progress !!!
The current status is that it *might* work in 2D like the original.
Currently struggling with performance.
Much cruft i.e. files that are not used or not correct.

The goals:
  - just as fast as the C version
  - smaller code, easier to read and understand
  - more general: work with multiple dimensions
    e.g. 1D text, 2D poetry, 2D images, 3D video, 3D music?

IOW test that Julia does permit generalized algorithms

Basic testing instructions, starting from scratch


>cd resynthesizerJulia

Activate the test project from the REPL in pkg mode
>julia
julia>]
pkg> activate test

Run the file that contains the testset

>julia --project=test test/resynthesizer.jl



From the REPL

Install julia

Start REPL

install packages,
or use a package.toml ???
(installs many supporting packages)

>import Pkg; Pkg.add("ReferenceTests")
>import Pkg; Pkg.add("TestImages")
>import Pkg; Pkg.add("ImageMagick")
>import Pkg; Pkg.add("ColorTypes")

Import the test framework
> using ReferenceTests
(compiles a long time)

Run the test suite by name
@testset "Resynthesizer"
