A metric returns a scalar measure between two values.

The algorithms that call a metric are generic on the types of values.

Metrics are usually NOT generic, but rather specialized on, the types of values.

Generic metrics might exist or be trivial to implement.
For example, if the values are scalars, then subtraction is a trivial metric.

IOW, the flow of types starts when you decide what values (e.g. Colors)
and containers of values (e.g. Images)
that you want to use.
Then you must decide whether a metric for those values exists,
and possibly implement a new metric for that type.

For example, suppose the use case is images of colors.
There exists a metric Colors.colordiff().
(But it doesn't seem to be performant.)
