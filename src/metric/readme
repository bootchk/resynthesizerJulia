A metric returns a scalar measure between two values.

The algorithms that call a metric are generic on the types of values.

Metrics are usually NOT generic, but rather specialized on, the types of values.

Generic metrics might exist or be trivial to implement.
For example, if the values are scalars, then subtraction is a trivial metric.

IOW, the flow of types starts when you decide what values (e.g. Colors)
and containers of values (e.g. Images)
that you want to use.
Then you must decide whether a metric for those values exists,
and possibly implement a new metric for that type.

For example, suppose the use case is images of colors.
There exists a metric Colors.colordiff().
(But it doesn't seem to perform well.)

### Types of values

The value may be a vector, e.g. a color is a vector of RGB channels.

A difference (a positive magnitude) is calculated
for each component of a value.

A metric function may be applied to each difference.
The original Resynthesizer algorithm applied
a function proportional to negative natural log of the cauchy PDF
(probability distribution function.)
